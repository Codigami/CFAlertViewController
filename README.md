`CFAlertViewController` is a library that helps you display and customise **Alerts, Action Sheets, and Notifications** on iPad and iPhone. It offers screen rotation as well as an adaptive UI support. CFAlertViewController’s API is almost similar to the native UIAlertController but it has a lot more functionalities than the native UIAlertController.

## Requirements :

CFAlertViewController works on devices (iPhone and iPad) with iOS 8.0+. It depends on the following Apple frameworks: 

* Foundation.framework
* UIKit.framework

## Installation

#### Cocoapods (recommended)
We assume that your Cocoapods is already configured. If you are new to Cocoapods, have a look at the [documentation](https://cocoapods.org/)

1. Add `pod 'CFAlertViewController'` to your Podfile.
2. Install the pod(s) by running `pod install` in terminal (in folder where `Podfile` file is located).

#### Swift Package Manager
CFAlertViewController is available through [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/). To install
it using SPM, simply add the following line to your `Package.swift` file:

``` swift
    dependencies: [
        .package(name: "CFAlertViewController", url: "https://github.com/Codigami/CFAlertViewController.git", branch: "master"),
    ]
```

#### Install using Source file  
Open the downloaded project in Xcode, then drag and drop folder named **CFAlertViewController** onto your project (use the "Product Navigator view"). Make sure to select Copy items when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project.

## Usage :

The above shown alert can easily be implemented using the code snippet:
```swift
// Create Alet View Controller
let alertController = CFAlertViewController(title: "You've hit the limit",
                                            message: "Looks like you've hit your daily follow/unfollow limit. Upgrade to our paid plan to be able to remove your limits.",
                                            textAlignment: .left,
                                            preferredStyle: .notification,
                                            didDismissAlertHandler: nil)

// Create Upgrade Action
let defaultAction = CFAlertAction(title: "UPGRADE",
                                  style: .Default,
                                  alignment: .right,
                                  backgroundColor: UIColor(red: CGFloat(46.0 / 255.0), green: CGFloat(204.0 / 255.0), blue: CGFloat(113.0 / 255.0), alpha: CGFloat(1)),
                                  textColor: nil,
                                  handler: { (action) in
                                    print("Button with title '" + action.title! + "' tapped")
})

// Add Action Button Into Alert
alertController.addAction(defaultAction)

// Present Alert View Controller
present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

## Customisations :

### Alerts

```swift
public convenience init(title: String?,
                        titleColor: UIColor?,
                        message: String?,
                        messageColor: UIColor?,
                        textAlignment: NSTextAlignment,
                        preferredStyle: CFAlertControllerStyle,
                        headerView: UIView?,
                        footerView: UIView?,
                        didDismissAlertHandler dismiss: CFAlertViewControllerDismissBlock?)
```

##### Title and Message
You can set a custom title and message text in the alert (pass `nil` if you don’t need them).

##### Title Color and Message Color
You can set a custom title and message text color in the alert (pass `nil` if you want to use Default color values).

##### Alignment
You can customise alignment of the title and message. Set the `textAlignment` property with one of the following values : 

```swift
NSTextAlignment.left,    
NSTextAlignment.right,    
NSTextAlignment.center,
NSTextAlignment.justified,
NSTextAlignment.natural
```

##### Alert Style  
Presentation style of the alert can be customised as Alert or Action sheet. Just set the `preferredStyle` property with one of the following values :
```swift
CFAlertControllerStyle.alert,
CFAlertControllerStyle.actionSheet,
CFAlertControllerStyle.notification
```

##### Background style
Background (overlay) of alert/action sheet can be blurred (Useful for security reasons in case the background needs to be hidden). Default value is `plain`. You can customize the blur style using `backgroundBlurView` property of type UIVisualEffectView. Update `backgroundStyle` property with one of the following enum values:

```swift
CFAlertControllerBackgroundStyle.plain,
CFAlertControllerBackgroundStyle.blur
```

##### Background color
You can change the background (overlay) color of the alert/actionsheet using the property `backgroundColor`.

##### Dismiss on background tap
By default, the alert gets dismissed after tapping on the background (overlay). Change `shouldDismissOnBackgroundTap` property to `false` to disable it. Do remember that whenever `shouldDismissOnBackgroundTap` property is set to `true`, the user will be able to dismiss `ActionSheet` or `Notification` using interactive swipe gesture.

##### Header / Footer
 You can add header and footer to the alert. Set properties `headerView` and `footerView` with custom views (subclass of UIView). You can pass nil to this properties to opt them out.  
 
 1) Some examples where you can make the use of header in alert (the dollar image is in header)
<p>
    <img src="/Images/Alert%20With%20Header.png" style="width: 100%" />
</p>

2) Some examples where you can make the use of footer in alert
<p>
    <img src="/Images/Alert%20With%20Footer.png" style="width: 100%" />
</p>

##### Callback
A block (of type CFAlertViewControllerDismissBlock) gets called when the Alert / Action Sheet is dismissed. You can use it to handle dismiss call back. It also gives you a reason of dismiss with below mentioned enums,
```swift
CFAlertControllerDismissReason.none,
CFAlertControllerDismissReason.onActionTap
CFAlertControllerDismissReason.onBackgroundTap
CFAlertControllerDismissReason.onInteractiveTransition
```

### Actions
```swift
public convenience init(title: String?,
                        style: CFAlertActionStyle,
                        alignment: CFAlertActionAlignment,
                        backgroundColor: UIColor?,
                        textColor: UIColor?,
                        handler: CFAlertActionHandlerBlock?)
```                           
##### Title

```swift
 CFAlertActionStyle.Default,
 CFAlertActionStyle.Cancel,
 CFAlertActionStyle.Destructive
```

##### Actions Alignment
Configure the alignment of the action button added to the alert view. Set `alignment` property of  CFAction constructor with one of the following action types
```swift
 CFAlertActionAlignment.justified,   // Action Button occupies the full width

 CFAlertActionAlignment.center
```
